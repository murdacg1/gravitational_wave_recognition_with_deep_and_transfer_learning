# gravitational_wave_recognition_with_deep_and_transfer_learning
Simple example of gravitational wave recognition with convolutional neural networks based on Michel Kana's work. This is  extended and improved using transfer learning. Note: You will need to change the file paths if you wish to run the python script.
