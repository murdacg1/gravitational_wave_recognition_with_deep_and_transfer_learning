Simple example of gravitational wave recognition with convolutional neural networks based on Michel Kana's work. This is extended and improved using transfer learning. Note: You will need to change the file paths if you wish to run the python script. Note2: Due to the large size of the data files, you will need to obtain them from https://github.com/michelkana/Deep-learning-projects/tree/master/Project3/data (filenames are GW_aug.npy and ND_aug.npy).
